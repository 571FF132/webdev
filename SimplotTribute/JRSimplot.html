        <p>John Richard ("Jack" or "J.R.") Simplot was an American entrepreneur and businessman best known as the founder of the J. R. Simplot Company, a Boise, Idaho based agricultural supplier specializing in potato products. In 2007 he was estimated to be the 89th-richest
          person in the United States, at $3.6 billion. At the time of his death at age 99 in May 2008, he was the oldest billionaire on the Forbes 400.</p>
        <p>Born in 1909, Simplot quit school in the eighth grade and left home to strike out on his own at age 14 in 1923. He worked on a farm near Declo, Idaho where he developed a creative method for feeding hogs, before getting into the potato and vegetable processing business. By World War II, the J. R. Simplot Company had become the largest shipper of fresh potatoes in the nation. In 1967, Simplot and McDonald's founder Ray Kroc agreed by handshake that the Simplot Company would provide frozen french fries to the restaurant chain.</p>
        
        <p>Simplot retired as president of his company in 1973, but remained as chairman until 1994. He held the title of Chairman Emeritus until his death in 2008. Simplot received an honorary degree from Utah State University in Logan in 2001,[6] honoring him for his many contributions to the agricultural industry of America, particularly the Intermountain West.</p>
